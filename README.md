# Le Quoc Trung - 1351046 - Midterm Project of CS427 - Game Development

This is the readme.md file for my midterm project of CS427 - Game Development

## Student Info

Student Name: Lê Quốc Trung

Student ID: 1351046

### Brief introduction

First of all, my idea was to create a simple but interesting game that could help players relax gently. In addition, I also have to consider the level of complexity of the game to suit the deadline time and my personal ability. I was thinking about childhood games and one of them was brick breaker, a simple game but it is enough to entertain.


### Applications

I created this game using Unity version 2019.3.0a3 and Visual Studio 2017 to write the C# scripts.

## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity.com/) - The game engine  used
* [Visual studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - the IDE used

## References

Developing games is a completely new field for me, besides, I am also working on graduation thesis and part-time for a company so my schedule is quite busy. So in addition to learning the knowledge in class, I also bought an online course at Udemy to get more knowledge and searched for more reference sources on the internet.
Here is the course that I bought: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/

Also to create this game, I refer to other sources on the Internet like:
